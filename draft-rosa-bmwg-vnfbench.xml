    <t>This document describes a common methodology for the automated benchmarking of
       Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) executed on general-purpose hardware.
       Specific cases of automated benchmarking methodologies for particular VNFs
       can be derived from this document. Two open source reference implementations
    are reported as running code embodiments of the proposed, automated benchmarking
    methodology. </t>

<middle> <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

  <t>The Benchmarking
  Methodology Working Group (BMWG) already presented considerations for
  benchmarking of VNFs and their infrastructure in <xref target='RFC8172' />.
  Similar to the motivation given in <xref target='RFC8172' />, the following
  aspects justify the need for VNF benchmarking: (i) pre-deployment
  infrastructure dimensioning to realize associated VNF performance profiles;
  (ii) comparison factor with physical network functions; (iii) and output
  results for analytical VNF development.</t>

  <t>Even if many methodologies already described by the BMWG, e.g., self-
  contained black-box benchmarking, can be applied to VNF benchmarking
  scenarios, further considerations have to be made. This is, on the one hand,
  because VNFs, which are software components, do not have strict and clear
  execution boundaries and depend on underlying virtualization environment
  parameters as well as management and orchestration decisions <xref
  target='ETS14a' />. On the other hand, can and should the flexible,
  software-based nature of VNFs be exploited to fully automate the entire
  benchmarking procedure end-to-end. This is an inherent need to align VNF
  benchmarking with the agile methods enabled by the concept of Network
  Functions Virtualization (NFV) <xref target='ETS14e' />. More specifically it
  allows: (i) the development of agile performance-focused DevOps
  methodologies for Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) of VNFs; (ii)
  the creation of on-demand VNF test descriptors for upcoming execution
  environments; (iii) the path for precise-analytics of automated
  catalogues of VNF performance profiles; (iv) and run-time mechanisms to
  assist VNF lifecycle orchestration/management workflows, e.g., automated
  resource dimensioning based on benchmarking insights.</t>

  <t>This document describes basic methodologies and guidelines to fully
  automate VNF benchmarking procedures, without limiting the automated process
  to a specific benchmark or infrastructure. After presenting initial
  considerations, the document first describes a generic architectural
  framework to setup automated benchmarking experiments. Second, the
  automation methodology is discussed, with a particular focus on experiment
  and procedure description approaches to support reproducibility of the
  automated benchmarks, a key challenge in VNF benchmarking. 
  Finally, two independent, open-source reference implementations are presented.
  The document addresses state-of-the-art work on VNF benchmarking from scientific
  publications and current developments in other standardization bodies (e.g.,
  <xref target='ETS14c' />, <xref target="ETS19f"/> and <xref target='RFC8204' />) wherever
  possible.</t>

<section title="Terminology" anchor="terms">
  <t> Common benchmarking terminology contained in this document
    is derived from <xref target="RFC1242" />.
    The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology as
    defined in the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
    (ETSI) NFV document <xref target="ETS14b" />.  Some of these terms,
    and others commonly used in this document, are defined below.</t>

  <t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="NFV:">Network Function Virtualization - the
    principle of separating network functions from the
    hardware they run on by using virtual hardware
    abstraction.</t>

   <t hangText="VNF:">Virtualized Network Function - a
  software-based network function. A VNF can be either represented
  by a single entity or be composed by a set of smaller, interconnected software components,
  called VNF components (VNFCs) <xref target='ETS14d' />. Those VNFs are also called
  composed VNFs.</t>

  <t hangText="VNFC:">Virtualized Network Function Component - a software
  component that implements (parts of) the VNF functionality. A VNF
  can consist of a single VNFC or multiple, interconnected VNFCs <xref target='ETS14d' /></t>

  <t hangText="VNFD:">Virtualised Network Function Descriptor -
    configuration template that describes a VNF in terms of its
    deployment and operational behaviour, and is used in the
    process of VNF on-boarding and managing the life cycle of a

</section>

<section title="Scope" anchor="scope">
  <t>This document assumes VNFs as black boxes when defining their
  benchmarking methodologies. White box approaches are assumed
  and analysed as a particular case under the proper considerations of internal
  VNF instrumentation, later discussed in this document.</t>

  <t>This document outlines a methodology for VNF
  benchmarking, specifically addressing its automation.</t>
</section>


<section title="Considerations" anchor="considerations">
  <t>VNF benchmarking considerations are defined in <xref target="RFC8172"/>.
  Additionally, VNF pre-deployment testing
  considerations are well explored in <xref target="ETS14c"/>. Further, ETSI provides test specifications for networking benchmarks and measurement methods for NFV infrastructure in <xref target="ETS19f"/> which complements the presented work on VNF benchmarking methodologies. 
 </t>

  <section title="VNF Testing Methods" anchor="methods">
    <t>Following ETSI's model in <xref target="ETS14c"/>, we distinguish three
    methods for VNF evaluation:</t>

    <t><list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="Benchmarking:">Where parameters (e.g., CPU, memory, storage)
    are provided and the corresponding
    performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput) are obtained.
    Note, such evaluations might
    create multiple reports, for example, with minimal latency or
    maximum throughput results.</t>

    <t hangText="Verification:">Both parameters
    and performance metrics are provided and
    a stimulus verifies if the given association is correct or not.</t>

    <t hangText="Dimensioning:">Performance metrics
    are provided and the corresponding parameters obtained.
    Note, multiple deployments may be required, or if possible,
    underlying allocated resources need to be dynamically altered.</t>
    </list></t>

    <t>Note: Verification and Dimensioning can be reduced to
    Benchmarking. Therefore, we focus on Benchmarking in the rest of
    the document.</t>
  </section>


<section title="Benchmarking Procedures" anchor="consider_procedures">

  <t>A (automated) benchmarking procedure can be divided into three sub-procedures:</t>

  <t><list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="Trial: "> Is a single process or iteration to obtain VNF 
          performance metrics from benchmarking measurements. A Test should always
          run multiple Trials to get statistical confidence about the obtained 
          measurements.</t>
        <t hangText="Test: "> Defines unique structural and functional parameters 
          (e.g., configurations, resource assignment) for benchmarked components
          to perform one or multiple Trials.
          Each Test must be executed following a particular benchmarking scenario
          composed by a Method. Proper measures must be taken to ensure statistical
          validity (e.g., independence across Trials of generated load
          patterns).</t>
        <t hangText="Method: "> Consists of one or more Tests to benchmark a VNF.
          A Method can explicitly list ranges of parameter values for the configuration of
          a benchmarking scenario and its components. Each value of such a range is to be
          realized in a Test. I.e., Methods can define parameter studies.</t>
  </list></t>

  <t>In general, automated VNF benchmarking Tests 
  must capture relevant causes of performance variability.
  To dissect a VNF benchmarking Test, in the sections that follow
  different benchmarking phases are categorized defining generic
  operations that may be automated.
  When automating a VNF benchmarking methodology, 
  all the influencing aspects on the performance
  of a VNF must be carefully analyzed and comprehensively reported,
  in each phase of the overall benchmarking process.</t>

  <section title="Phase I: Deployment" anchor="orchestration">
    <t> The placement (i.e., assignment and allocation of resources) and the
    interconnection, physical and/or virtual, of network function(s) and 
    benchmarking components can be realized by orchestration platforms 
    (e.g., OpenStack, Kubernetes, Open Source MANO).
    In automated manners, the realization of a benchmarking testbed/scenario 
    through those means usually rely on network service templates 
    (e.g., TOSCA, Heat, YANG). 
    Such descriptors have to capture all relevant details of the execution 
    environment to allow the benchmarking framework to correctly instantiate
    the SUT as well as helper functions required for a Test.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Phase II: Configuration" anchor="configuration">
    <t> The configuration of benchmarking components and
    VNFs (e.g., populate routing table, load PCAP source files in 
    source of traffic stimulus) to execute the Test settings can be realized by 
    programming interfaces in an automated way.
    In the scope of NFV, there might exist management interfaces to control
    a VNF during a benchmarking Test.
    Likewise, infrastructure or orchestration components can establish the proper configuration of
    an execution environment to realize all the capabilities enabling
    the description of the benchmarking Test.
    Each configuration registry, its deployment timestamp and target, 
    must all be contained in the VNF benchmarking report.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Phase III: Execution" anchor="execution">
    <t> In the execution of a benchmarking Test, the VNF configuration can be programmed to be
    changed by itself or by a VNF management platform.
    It means that during a Trial execution, particular behaviors of a VNF can be automatically triggered,
    e.g., auto-scaling of its internal components.
    Those must be captured in the detailed procedures of the VNF execution and its
    performance report.
    I.e., the execution of a Trial can determine arrangements of internal states inside a VNF,
    which can interfere in observed benchmarking metrics.
    For instance, in a particular benchmarking case where the monitoring measurements
    of the VNF and/or execution environment are available for extraction,
    Tests should be run to verify if the monitoring of the VNF and/or execution environment
    can impact the VNF performance metrics.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Phase IV: Report" anchor="report">
    <t> The report of a VNF benchmarking Method might contain generic metrics
    (e.g., CPU and memory consumption) and VNF-specific traffic processing metrics
    (e.g., transactions or throughput), which can be stored and processed
    in generic or specific ways (e.g., by statistics or machine learning algorithms). More details about possible metrics and the corresponding capturing methods can be found in <xref target="ETS19g"/>.
    If automated procedures are applied over the generation of a benchmarking report, 
    those must be detailed in the report itself, jointly with their input raw measurements 
    and output processed data.
    I.e., any algorithm used in the generation of processed metrics must be disclosed
    in the report.</t>

  <t> As shown in <xref target="fig_02" />, the outcome of an automated VNF 
  benchmarking methodology, must be captured in a VNF Benchmarking Report (VNF-BR),
  consisting of two parts:</t>

  <t><list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="VNF Benchmarking Descriptor (VNF-BD) -- "> contains all required
    definitions and requirements to deploy, configure,
    execute, and reproduce VNF benchmarking tests. VNF-BDs are defined
    by the developer of a benchmarking methodology and serve as input to
    the benchmarking process, before being included in the generated VNF-BR.</t>

    <t hangText="VNF Performance Profile (VNF-PP) -- "> contains
    all measured metrics resulting from the execution of a
    benchmarking. Additionally, it might also contain additional recordings
    of configuration parameters used during the execution of the
    benchmarking scenario to facilitate comparability of VNF-BRs. </t>
  </list></t>

  <t>A VNF-BR correlates structural and functional
  parameters of VNF-BD with extracted VNF benchmarking metrics
  of the obtained VNF-PP.
  The content of each part of a VNF-BR is described in the following sections.</t>

  <section title="VNF Benchmarking Descriptor (VNF-BD)" anchor="vnf-bd">
    <t> VNF Benchmarking Descriptor (VNF-BD) -- an artifact that
    specifies a Method of how to measure a VNF Performance
    Profile. The specification includes structural and functional
    instructions and variable parameters at different
    abstraction levels (e.g., topology of the deployment scenario,
    benchmarking target metrics, parameters of benchmarking
    components).  A VNF-BD may be specific to a VNF or applicable to
    several VNF types. It can be used to elaborate a VNF
    benchmark deployment scenario aiming at the extraction of
    particular VNF performance metrics. An initial YANG model
	for VNF-BDs is available at <xref target="yang-vnf-bd"/>.</t>

    <t> The following items define the VNF-BD contents.</t>

      <section title="Descriptor Headers" anchor="overall-desc">
          <t>The definition of parameters concerning the
          descriptor file, e.g., its version, identidier, 
          name, author and description.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Target Information" anchor="target-info">
        <t>General information addressing the target VNF(s) the VNF-BD is applicable,
          with references to any specific characteristics, i.e., the VNF type,
          model, version/release, author, vendor, architectural components, among
          any other particular features.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Experiments" anchor="overall-exps">
          <t>The specification of the number of executions for
          Trials, Tests and Method. The execution of a 
          VNF-BD corresponds to the execution of the specified Method.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Environment" anchor="overall-env">
          <t>The details referring to the name, description, and
            information associated with the interfaces needed for the 
            management and orchestration (MANO), if necessary, of the specified VNF-BD scenario.
            I.e., it refers to a specific interface that receives the
            VNF-BD scenario information and converts it to the 
            template needed for an orchestration platform.
            In this case, the means to the manager component interface
            such orchestration platform must be provided, as well as its outcome orchestration
            status information (e.g., management interfaces of deployed components).</t>

          <t>Further details about the concrete execution environment is, however,
            provided by the VNF-PP to keep the VNF-BD technology agnostic (see <xref target="exec-env" />).</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Scenario" anchor="scenario">
        <t>This section contains all information needed
        to describe the deployment of all involved functional components mandatory
        for the execution of the benchmarking Tests addressed by the VNF-BD.</t>

        <section title="Nodes" anchor="scenario-nodes">
          <t>Information about each component in a benchmarking setup (see <xref target="setup" />).
          It contains the identification, name, image, role (i.e., agent, monitor, SUT), connection-points and resource requirements
          (i.e., allocation of CPU, memory, disk).</t>

          <t>A SUT is always considered to be the full set of VNFCs comprised by the 
            VNF. Thus all VNFCs of a VNF are always benchmarked together because all of them are 
            needed to implement the full set of the VNF's functionalities. This is aligned with the results presented in <xref target="Peu-b"/> that show that VNF compositions should be benchmarked as a whole. Benchmarking 
            single VNFCs in isolation could be considered as a particular case, i.e., whitebox scenario which is out of scope of this draft.</t>

          <t>The lifecycle specification of a node lists all the workflows that must be
            realized on it during a Test. For instance, main workflows include: create, start, stop, delete.
            Particular workflows can be specified containing the required parameters and implementation.
            Those details must reflect the actions taken on or by a node that might affect the 
            VNF performance profile.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Links" anchor="scenario-links">
          <t>Links contain information about the data plane links interconnecting the components 
            of a benchmarking setup. Links refer to two or more connection-points of a
            node. A link might refer to be part of a network. Depending on the link type, 
            the network might be implemented as a layer 2 mesh, or as directional-oriented 
            traffic forwarding flow entries.
            Links also detain resource requirements, specifying the minimum bandwidth, latency, 
            and frame loss rate for the execution of benchmarking Tests.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Policies" anchor="scenario-pols">
          <t> Involves the definition of execution environment policies
            to run the Tests.
            Policies might specify the (anti-)affinity placement rules for each
            component in the topology, min/max allocation of resources,
            and specific enabling technologies (e.g., DPDK, SR-IOV, PCIE) needed

    <section title="VNF Performance Profile (VNF-PP)" anchor="vnf-pp">

      <t> VNF Performance Profile (VNF-PP) -- an output artifact of a 
        VNF-BD execution performed by a Manager component. It contains all the metrics
        from monitor(s) and/or agent(s) components after realizing and executing the prober(s)
        and/or the listener(s) proceedings specified in its corresponding VNF-BD.
        Metrics are grouped according to the execution of the trial(s) and test(s)
        defined by a VNF-BD. A VNF-PP is specific to a unique VNF specification
        (e.g., image, version, format).
        It can be used to derive and extract statistics
        of particular VNF performance metrics recorded in the VNF-PP.</t>

      <t>More specifically, each VNF-PP is defined by a structure that allows 
        benchmarking results to be presented in a logical and unified format.
        A VNF-PP report is the result of an unique Test, while its content, the so called snapshot(s),
        correspond to a single Trial each. A snapshot is defined by a single Agent or Monitor.
        Each snapshot contains evaluation(s), each one being the output of a single 
        prober/listener. And each evaluation contains one or more metrics.
        In summary, a VNF-PP aggregates results from reports (i.e., Test(s)); 
        a report aggregates Agent(s) and Monitor(s) results (i.e., Trial(s)); 
        a snapshot aggregates prober(s) or listener(s) results; 
        and an evaluation aggregates metrics. An initial YANG model
		for VNF-PPs is available at <xref target="yang-vnf-pp"/>.

  <section title="Particular Cases" anchor="specific">

    <t>As described in <xref target="RFC8172"/>, VNF benchmarking might require to
    change and adapt existing benchmarking methodologies. More specifically, the
    following cases need to be considered.</t>

    <!-- UPB: Made each bullet to a subsection. Re-orderd according to RFC8172 -->
    <section title="Capacity" anchor="specific_capacity">  <t>VNFs are usually
    deployed inside containers or VMs to build an abstraction layer between
    physical resources and the resources available to the VNF. According to <xref
    target="RFC8172"/>, it may be more representative to design experiments in a
    way that the VMs hosting the VNFs are operating at maximum of 50% utilization
    and split the workload among several VMs, to mitigateside effects of
    overloaded VMs. Those cases are supported by the presented automation
    methodologies through VNF-BDs that enable direct control over the resource
    assignments and topology layouts used for a benchmarking experiment.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Redundancy" anchor="specific_redund">
    <t>As a VNF might be composed of multiple components (VNFCs), there exist
	different schemas of redundancy where particular VNFCs would be in active
	or standby mode. For such cases, particular monitoring endpoints should be
	specified in VNF-BD so listeners can capture the relevant aspects of benchmarking
	when VNFCs would be in active/standby modes. In this particular case, capturing
	the relevant aspects of internal functionalities of a VNF and its internal
	components provides important measurements to characterize the dynamics of a
	VNF, those must be reflected in its VNF-PP.
	</t> </section>

    <section title="Isolation" anchor="specific_isolation">  <t>One of the main
    challenges of NFV is to create isolation between VNFs. Benchmarking the
    quality of this isolation behavior can be achieved by Agents that take the
    role of a noisy neighbor, generating a particular workload in synchrony with a
    benchmarking  procedure over a VNF. Adjustments of the Agent's noisy workload,
    frequency, virtualization level, among others, must be detailed in the  VNF-
    BD.</t> </section>

    <section title="Failure Handling" anchor="specific_failure"> <t>Hardware and
    software components will fail or have errors and thus trigger healing actions
    of the benchmarked VNFs (self-healing). Benchmarking procedures must also
    capture the dynamics of this VNF behavior, e.g., if a container or VM restarts
    because the VNF software crashed. This results in offline periods that must be
    captured in the benchmarking reports, introducing additional metrics, e.g.,
    max. time-to-heal. The presented concept, with a flexible VNF-PP structure to
    record arbitrary metrics, enables automation of this case.</t> </section>

    <section title="Elasticity and Flexibility" anchor="specific_elas_flex">
    <t>Having software based network functions and the possibility of a VNF to be
    composed by multiple components (VNFCs), internal events of the VNF might
    trigger changes in VNF behavior, e.g.,activating functionalities associated
    with elasticity such as automated scaling. These state changes and triggers
    (e.g. the VNF's scaling state) must be captured in the benchmarking results
    (VNF-PP) to provide a detailed characterization of the VNF's performance
    behavior in different states.</t> </section>

    <section title="Handling Configurations" anchor="specific_configs"> <!-- UPB:
    this one is new in this draft, it is also considered in RFC8172 --> <t>As
    described in <xref target="RFC8172"/>, does the sheer number of test
    conditions and configuration combinations create a challenge for VNF
    benchmarking. As suggested, machine readable output formats, as they are
    presented in this document, will allow automated benchmarking procedures to
    optimize the tested configurations. Approaches for this are, e.g., machine
    learning-based configuration space sub-sampling methods, such as <xref
    target="Peu-c"/>.</t> </section>

    <section title="White Box VNF" anchor="specific_whitebox"> <!-- UPB: this is
    from draft-02. But not in the list in RFC8172 --> <t>A benchmarking setup must
    be able to  define scenarios with and without monitoring components inside the
    VNFs and/or the hosting container or VM. If no monitoring solution is
    available from within the VNFs, the benchmark is following the black-box
    concept. If, in contrast, those additional sources of information from within
    the VNF are available, VNF-PPs must be able to handle these additional VNF
    performance metrics.</t> </section>

  </section>
</section>


<section title="Open Source Reference Implementations" anchor="opensource">
  <t> Currently, technical motivating factors in favor of the automation
  of VNF benchmarking methodologies comprise:
  (i) the facility to run high-fidelity and commodity traffic generators 
  by software; 
  (ii) the existent means to construct synthetic traffic workloads purely
  by software (e.g., handcrafted pcap files);  
  (iii) the increasing availability of datasets containing actual sources 
  of production traffic able to be reproduced in benchmarking tests;
  (iv) the existence of a myriad of automating tools and open interfaces
  to programmatically manage VNFs;
  (v) the varied set of orchestration platforms enabling the allocation of
  resources and instantition of VNFs through automated machineries based 
  on well-defined templates;
  (vi) the ability to utilize a large tool set of software components to
  compose pipelines that mathematically analyze benchmarking metrics in 
  automated ways.</t>

  <t>In simple terms, network softwarization enables automation. 
  There are two open source reference implementations that are build to
  automate benchmarking of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs).</t>

  <section title="Gym" anchor="opensource_gym">

    <t>The software, named Gym, is a framework for automated benchmarking of
    Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs). It was coded following the initial ideas
    presented in a 2015 scientific paper entitled “VBaaS: VNF Benchmark-as-a-Service”
    <xref target="Rosa-a"/>.  Later, the evolved design and prototyping ideas were presented at
    IETF/IRTF meetings seeking impact into NFVRG and BMWG.</t>

    <t>Gym was built to receive high-level test descriptors and execute them to
    extract VNFs profiles, containing measurements of performance metrics –
    especially to associate resources allocation (e.g., vCPU) with packet
    processing metrics (e.g., throughput) of VNFs. From the original research
    ideas <xref target="Rosa-a"/>, such output profiles might be used by orchestrator functions
    to perform VNF lifecycle tasks (e.g., deployment, maintenance, tear-down).</t>

    <t>In <xref target="Rosa-b"/> Gym was utilized to benchmark a decomposed
    IP Multimedia Subsystem VNF. And in <xref target="Rosa-c"/>, a virtual switch
    (Open vSwitch - OVS) was the target VNF of Gym for the analysis of VNF benchmarking automation.
    Such articles validated Gym as a prominent open
    source reference implementation for VNF benchmarking tests.
    Such articles set important contributions as discussion of the lessons
    learned and the overall NFV performance testing landscape, included automation.</t>

    <t>Gym stands as one open source reference implementation
    that realizes the VNF benchmarking methodologies presented in this
    document.
    Gym is released as open source tool under
    Apache 2.0 license <xref target="gym"/>.</t>    
  </section>

  <section title="tng-bench" anchor="opensource_tng_profile">

    <t>Another software that focuses on implementing a framework to benchmark
    VNFs is the "5GTANGO VNF/NS Benchmarking Framework" also called "tng-bench"
    (previously "son-profile") and was developed as  part of the two European
    Union H2020 projects SONATA NFV and 5GTANGO <xref target="tango"/>. Its
    initial ideas were presented in <xref target="Peu-a"/> and the system design
    of the end-to-end prototype was presented in <xref target="Peu-b"/>.</t>

    <t>Tng-bench aims to be a framework for the end-to-end automation of VNF
    benchmarking processes. Its goal is to automate the benchmarking process in
    such a way that VNF-PPs can be generated without further human interaction.
    This enables the integration of VNF benchmarking into continuous integration
    and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines so that new VNF-PPs are generated
    on-the-fly for every new software version of a VNF. Those automatically
    generated VNF-PPs can then be bundled with the VNFs and serve as inputs for
    orchestration systems, fitting to the original research ideas presented in
    <xref target="Rosa-a"/> and <xref target="Peu-a"/>.</t>

    <t>Following the same high-level VNF testing purposes as Gym, namely:
    Comparability, repeatability, configurability, and interoperability, tng-
    bench specifically aims to explore description approaches for VNF
    benchmarking experiments. In <xref target="Peu-b"/> a prototype
    specification for VNF-BDs is presented which not only allows to specify
    generic, abstract VNF benchmarking experiments, it also allows to describe
    sets of parameter configurations to be tested during the benchmarking
    process, allowing the system to automatically execute complex parameter
    studies on the SUT, e.g., testing a VNF's performance under different CPU,
    memory, or software configurations.</t>

    <t>Tng-bench was used to perform a set of initial benchmarking experiments
    using different VNFs, like a Squid proxy, an Nginx load balancer, and a
    Socat TCP relay in <xref target="Peu-b"/>. Those VNFs have not only been
    benchmarked in isolation, but also in combined setups in which up to three
    VNFs were chained one after each other. These experiments were used to test
    tng-bench for scenarios in which composed VNFs, consisting of multiple VNF
    components (VNFCs), have to be benchmarked. The presented results highlight
    the need to benchmark composed VNFs in end-to-end scenarios rather than only
    benchmark each individual component in isolation, to produce meaningful VNF-
    PPs for the complete VNF.</t>

    <t>Tng-bench is actively developed and released as open source tool under
    Apache 2.0 license <xref target="tng-bench"/>. A larger set of example
	benchmarking results of various VNFs is available in <xref target="Peu-d"/>.</t>

<section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
  <t>Benchmarking tests described in this document are limited to the
   performance characterization of VNFs in a lab environment
   with isolated network.</t>

   <t>The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.</t>

   <t> Special capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the VNF benchmarking deployment scenario specifically for
   benchmarking purposes. Any implications for network security arising
   from the VNF benchmarking deployment scenario SHOULD be identical in the lab and in production
   networks.</t>
